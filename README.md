# AutoDependencyProperty.Fody #

**UNMAINTAINED**: This library is no longer maintained, because I rarely use Windows these days. It has not been updated in years. You are welcome to adopt the library if you find it useful.

This is a [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) plugin that automatically generates DependencyProperty boilerplate from simple C# properties.
